		For analysis, I have taken data of final and semi final matches of all years. Then, I have compared data by variable between two players of particular those matches. Moreover, I have analysed data of particular player for that particular variable i.e. Let's say, final match of 2004 is between Roger Federer and Marat Safin, then we can analyse data by "Ace", "Error", "Double"....etc variables. If "Ace" variable is selected, then we can analyse both players by "Ace" Varibale and moreover, I am also analysing Roger Federer's data of "Ace" variable of final match with average of other round(First, Second, third, Fourth, Quarter) and same for Marat Safin's "Ace" data. So that, we can know that, how well/bad player performed in semifinal and final with respect to other round.

		I have used Donut chart to compare data of two players by selected variable. I have used bar chart to compare partucular match's data with other round for particular player by selected variable. So, we can see three graphs at one time, one for comparing both player and other two graphs for players to compare final or emi final's data with other round's data.

		After website loaded, user will be asked to select year from Dropdown list. After user selects year, Final and semifinal list weill be displayed in the screen. When user selects particular match from list, user will be asked to select variable from dropdown list. Now, when user select particular varible, three different graphs will be created. Now, when you change varibale or match from given options, all three graphs will be updated. Here, I am not creating different graph ech time. I am just changing data of all three grph depending upon user selection.
