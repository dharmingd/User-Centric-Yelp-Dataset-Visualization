<a href="http://yelpdatasetvisualization.000webhostapp.com/">Demo</a>

The problem of the project was to apply the knowledge and standards of Data Visualization to interactively and intelligently visualize 6.52 GB of dataset provide by Yelp in such a way that user can easily filter out useful information from huge dataset those are not currently visualized by Yelp itself.

The solution of the project statement is to visualize dataset based on the ratings of users instead of restaurants which is not currently being visualized by Yelp. We have preprocessed the dataset in order to make dataset user-oriented rather than restaurant-oriented. We have observed that users of Yelp are categorized based on six different attributes. Based on all six attributes, we came up with our own formula that ranks users of yelp. Based on filter dataset, we have developed interactive choropleth US map based on ratings of states for top five business categories (Restaurant, Shopping, Health &Medical, Home & Services and Beauty & Spa) of USA and interactive donut charts for comparing top users on different attributes. 

The result of project is, User will be able to see which state has highest to lowest rating based on selected business category. User will be able to top users of US as well as top users of state based on selected category. User will be able to see top businesses of user in state. Moreover, User will be able to compare between two users. As a result, user will be able to select his/her next destination.
